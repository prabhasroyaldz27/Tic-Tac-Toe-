NVT (Noun–Verb Technique)

From the use cases, we apply the Noun–Verb Technique (NVT) to extract key nouns as candidate classes/objects and verbs as candidate methods/operations. 
This helps in systematically bridging requirement analysis with UML modeling and class design.

Nouns → Candidate Classes

Verbs → Candidate Methods

startGame() – initialize the game with board size

makeMove() – place X or O on the board

checkWinner() – verify vertical or horizontal win

checkDraw() – verify if the board is full without winner

notifyOpponent() – send notification to the other player

endGame() – declare result (winner/draw)
