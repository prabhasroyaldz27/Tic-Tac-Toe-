Requirement Analysis
Functional Requirements

Scalable Board – Instead of the standard 3×3 grid, the game should support an N×N board.

Winning Rules –

A player wins if they form the same pattern vertically or horizontally.

Diagonal wins are not allowed (custom constraint).

Draw Condition – If no winning condition is met and all cells are filled, the match is declared a draw.

Player Notification – When Player 1 places a symbol (e.g., O), the system should notify Player 2 of the move (simulated as in-app notification).
